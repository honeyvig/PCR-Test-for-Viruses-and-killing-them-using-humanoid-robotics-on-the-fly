    Viruses and PCR Tests
        There are thousands of viruses discovered over the years. Some of the well-known ones include:
            Bacteria-associated viruses (bacteriophages)
            Human viruses (e.g., influenza, HIV, COVID-19, Hepatitis, Herpes simplex, etc.)
            Animal viruses (e.g., rabies, avian influenza)
            Plant viruses (e.g., tobacco mosaic virus)

    PCR tests are commonly used for detecting specific genetic material of viruses. For example:
        COVID-19: Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
        Influenza: PCR assays targeting influenza-specific genes
        HIV: PCR for detecting HIV RNA or DNA
        Hepatitis: PCR for detecting hepatitis B or C viral RNA or DNA

    Humanoid Robotics and Virus Detection/Elimination Humanoid robots could be used in real-time virus detection and even virus elimination in certain environments, though this is mostly conceptual and currently under research. These robots could potentially:
        Use sensors and AI algorithms to detect virus particles in the air.
        Use disinfection methods (e.g., UV light, chemical sprays) to kill viruses.
        The robot could use robotic arms to apply treatments to surfaces or environments in real-time.

    Scientific Methods for Virus Elimination
        UV-C light: Proven to kill viruses by damaging their DNA or RNA.
        Ozone treatment: Effective for airborne viruses.
        Disinfectant sprays (e.g., alcohol-based, hydrogen peroxide).
        Antiviral agents: Chemical or natural (like garlic or certain plant extracts).

    Natural Methods
        Certain essential oils (e.g., eucalyptus, tea tree) have been researched for their antiviral properties.
        Herbal treatments like turmeric, ginger, and licorice root are traditionally believed to have antiviral effects.

    Python Code for Virus Detection and Killing Function In terms of writing Python code for performing PCR tests in real-time and virus elimination, it's important to note that real-time PCR requires laboratory equipment, specialized probes, and a machine like a thermal cycler. However, I can provide a conceptual Python approach for virus detection based on sample analysis and simulated outcomes.

The code below is a simplified approach where we simulate detection of viruses based on input samples. In real life, virus detection would need much more sophisticated tools, real-time testing equipment, and integration with robotics.

import random

# Virus database (simplified for illustration)
viruses = {
    "COVID-19": "SARS-CoV-2",
    "Influenza": "Influenza A/B",
    "HIV": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus",
    "Hepatitis": "Hepatitis B/C",
    "Herpes": "Herpes Simplex Virus"
}

# Simulating a PCR Test that detects viral DNA/RNA
def pcr_test(sample):
    print(f"Running PCR test on the sample...")
    # Randomly simulate detection of virus based on sample's content
    detected_virus = random.choice(list(viruses.values()))
    print(f"Virus detected: {detected_virus}")
    return detected_virus

# Function to "kill" viruses
def kill_virus(virus_name):
    print(f"Attempting to kill virus: {virus_name}")
    # Simulate different methods of virus elimination
    if virus_name == "SARS-CoV-2":
        print("Using UV-C light and chemical disinfectants to kill COVID-19...")
    elif virus_name == "Influenza A/B":
        print("Applying antiviral spray and UV-C light for Influenza...")
    elif virus_name == "HIV":
        print("Administering HIV-specific antiviral agents...")
    elif virus_name == "Hepatitis B/C":
        print("Administering antiviral treatment for Hepatitis B/C...")
    elif virus_name == "Herpes Simplex":
        print("Using antiviral creams and UV light for Herpes...")
    else:
        print("Virus not recognized, using broad-spectrum disinfection methods...")
    print("Virus successfully neutralized!")

# Simulate a humanoid robot performing tests in real-time
def humanoid_robot_test(sample):
    print("Humanoid Robot: Initializing virus detection process...")
    detected_virus = pcr_test(sample)
    
    # If virus detected, apply elimination method
    kill_virus(detected_virus)

# Sample environment check
environment_sample = "Sample from environment"  # In reality, this would be a sample from air or surfaces
humanoid_robot_test(environment_sample)

How the code works:

    Virus Detection: The pcr_test function simulates running a PCR test on an environment sample. It randomly selects a virus from a predefined list of viruses.
    Virus Elimination: The kill_virus function simulates different methods of virus elimination based on the detected virus. It can apply UV-C light, chemical treatments, or antiviral agents.
    Humanoid Robot: The humanoid_robot_test function simulates a humanoid robot conducting the virus detection and elimination process.

Limitations and Future Considerations:

    Real-Time PCR: Real PCR tests require actual laboratory setups and specialized equipment. The Python code here is more of a simulation.
    Virus Elimination: The process of virus elimination depends on the type of virus and may involve physical interventions (e.g., UV light) that robots could carry out in real time, though many of these processes would require real-world verification and research.

To perform this task in a real environment, you would need robotics integrated with advanced virus detection systems (like air quality sensors, and PCR equipment) and virus-killing technologies (UV-C light, ozone generators, etc.).
